SOLID are five basic principles which help to create good software architecture. SOLID is an acronym where:-

S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle
O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)
L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)
I stands for ISP ( Interface segregation principle)
D stands for DIP ( Dependency inversion principle)

Understanding “S”- SRP (Single responsibility principle)
The best way to understand SOLID is by understanding what problem it tries to solve. Have a look at the code below, can you guess what the problem is ?( You are not going to get BEER to guess it J , because it’s too simple).
